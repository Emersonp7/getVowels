My idea was to be able to write one small program that can get all the vowels in a string and be able to recreate the same program in different languages.
I was able to recreate the program in C++, Javascript, Java, Python, Dart and Typescript. The resutls will show on screen an array of the letters that are vowels that were from the string.
